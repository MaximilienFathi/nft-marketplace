# NFT marketplace - A Vanilla JS Solution

NFT marketplace is a website that allows users to discover, buy and sell
non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Given that my knowledge of back-end development is 
currently very limited, I have decided to solely focus on the front-end part 
of the project for now.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Have access to a landing page with proper sections (e.g. header, hero, footer, etc.)
- View trending NFTs at a glance
- View each NFT buyout section via a modal window
- View top creators at a glance
- View each creator's dashboard via a modal window
- Have access to specific creator analytics (shown using classes and chart libraries)
- Flip between each NFT and associated creator modal window
- Access specific parts of the page using links

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) - JavaScript charting library

### What I learned

While working through this project, the major learnings involved:

- The gain in HTML, CSS, JavaScript knowledge while creating every component 
  of the website from scratch.
- The use of smooth scrolling animations.
- The use of sticky navigation.
- The creation and manipulation (e.g. positioning, opening/closing, etc.) of modal windows.
- The use of APIs and how to consume promises in asynchronous coding.
- The use of charting libraries to create beautiful charts that match user data.
- The use of the MVC pattern.



- The handling of routing with React projects involving multiple pages
- The use and customization of components from libraries like Material UI
- The use of UI design styles like glassmorphism to create beautiful websites
- The main blockchain technology and cryptocurrency-related concepts

### Continued development

Even though I have accomplished many of my initial objectives for this
project, there are still some new features I wish to include such as:

- Some UI changes, particularly for the home page
- More pages such as one dedicated to blog posts
- A page for each coin exchange outlining their performance
- A complete back-end mechanism with actual user accounts
- A proper way of having real cryptocurrency transactions using Web3
  technologies

### Useful resources

- [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) - This proved insightful
  when I was stuck on specific coding issues.
- [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) - This was very useful when it
  came to gathering API data for various cryptocurrencies and coin exchanges.
- [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) - This helped me discover great web
  design inspirations.
- [maketintsandshades](https://maketintsandshades.com/) - This was a
  great tool for generating lighter and darker versions of specific colors.
- [storyset](https://storyset.com/) - This provided me with a variety of
  great pictures to include in my project while still being similar in style
  as well as customizable (i.e. colors can be modified).
- [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) - This helped me quickly generate
  necessary files for the favicon and its different formats.
