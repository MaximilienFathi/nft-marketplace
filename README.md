# NFT marketplace - A Vanilla JS Solution

NFT marketplace is a website that allows users to discover, buy and sell
non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Given that my knowledge of back-end development is 
currently very limited, I have decided to solely focus on the front-end part 
of the project for now.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Have access to a landing page with proper sections (e.g. header, hero, footer, etc.)
- View trending NFTs at a glance.
- View each NFT buyout section via a modal window.
- View top creators at a glance.
- View each creator's dashboard via a modal window.
- Have access to specific creator analytics (shown using classes and chart 
  libraries).
- Flip between each NFT and associated creator modal window.
- Access specific parts of the page using links.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) - JavaScript charting library

### What I learned

While working through this project, the major learnings involved:

- The gain in HTML, CSS, JavaScript knowledge while creating every component 
  of the website from scratch.
- The manipulation of DOM elements.
- The use of smooth scrolling animations.
- The use of sticky navigation.
- The creation and manipulation (e.g. positioning, opening/closing, etc.) of modal windows.
- The use of APIs and how to consume promises in asynchronous coding.
- The use of charting libraries to create beautiful charts that match user data.
- The use of the MVC pattern.

### Continued development

Even though I have accomplished many of my initial objectives for this
project, there are still some new features I wish to include such as:

- Some UI changes, particularly for the hero section.
- More pages such as ones dedicated to displaying all NFTs and creators.
- A way of sending news and updates to subscribed users.
- A complete back-end mechanism with actual user accounts.
- A proper way of trading NFTs using Web3 technologies.

While I may want to improve my project later on by using popular libraries 
and frameworks such as React or Angular, I purposefully decided to stay with 
vanilla JS so far in order to have a better understanding of the language itself.
