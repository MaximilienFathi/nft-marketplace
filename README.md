## Overview

### The challenge

NFT Marketplace should aim to meet the following objectives:

- **Engaging Landing Page:** Immerse yourself in the world of NFTs with a beautifully designed landing page featuring well-defined sections like a header, hero section, footer, and more, providing intuitive navigation and clear information about the marketplace.
- **Discover Trending NFTs:** Dive into a curated collection of NFTs, showcasing the hottest items at a glance on the landing page.
- **Seamless NFT Viewing:** Click on any NFT to explore details in a user-friendly modal window, complete with buyout information.
- **Meet the Creators:** Explore a dedicated section highlighting top creators within the NFT marketplace.
- **Unlock Creator Insights:** Delve into a creator's profile through a modal window, featuring data visualizations and analytics (utilizing classes and chart libraries) to understand their artistic journey and impact.
- **Effortless Navigation:** Seamlessly flip between NFTs and their corresponding creator profiles using intuitive navigation. Access specific sections of the marketplace with clearly defined links, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) - JavaScript charting library
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - Web application bundler

### What I learned

While working through this project, the major learnings involved:

- A deepened understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a result of my UI framework-free approach.
- The manipulation of DOM elements.
- The use of smooth scrolling animations.
- The implementation of sticky navigation.
- The creation and manipulation (e.g. positioning, opening/closing, etc.) of modal windows.
- The use of APIs and how to consume promises in asynchronous coding.
- The integration of charting libraries to create beautiful charts that match user data.
- The use of the MVC pattern.

### Continued development

Even though I have accomplished many of my initial objectives for this
project, there are still some new features I wish to include such as:

- Some UI changes, particularly for the hero section.
- More pages such as ones dedicated to displaying all NFTs and creators.
- A way of sending news and updates to subscribed users.
- A complete back-end mechanism with actual user accounts.
- A proper way of trading NFTs using Web3 technologies.

While I may want to improve my project later on by using popular libraries
and frameworks such as React or Angular, I purposefully decided to stay with
vanilla JS so far in order to have a better understanding of the language itself.
