# NFT marketplace - A Vanilla JS Solution

NFT marketplace is a website that allows users to discover, buy and sell
non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Given that my knowledge of back-end development is 
currently very limited, I have decided to solely focus on the front-end part 
of the project for now.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View trending NFTs at a glance
- View top creators at a glance
- Set specific cryptocurrencies as favorites
- Rank cryptocurrencies and coin exchanges by a specific metric
- Search and find specific cryptocurrencies and coin exchanges
- View current balance for specific cryptocurrency and recent amount change
- View specific cryptocurrency past and current performance
- Simulate a transaction from one currency to another with customizable settings
- Have access to specific cryptocurrency website, social networks, source
  code, etc.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - JavaScript HTTP requests library
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript UI library
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) - React component library
- [react-chartjs-2](https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/) - React charting library
- [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/) - React routing library
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - JavaScript testing framework
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) - Complementary testing library for React

### What I learned

While working through this project, the major learnings involved:

- The use of React as well as the more recent functional components and hooks
- The gain in HTML, CSS, JavaScript knowledge while creating many
  React components from scratch
- The handling of routing with React projects involving multiple pages
- The use and customization of components from libraries like Material UI
- The use of UI design styles like glassmorphism to create beautiful websites
- The main blockchain technology and cryptocurrency-related concepts

### Continued development

Even though I have accomplished many of my initial objectives for this
project, there are still some new features I wish to include such as:

- Some UI changes, particularly for the home page
- More pages such as one dedicated to blog posts
- A page for each coin exchange outlining their performance
- A complete back-end mechanism with actual user accounts
- A proper way of having real cryptocurrency transactions using Web3
  technologies
